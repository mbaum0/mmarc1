The current Design.pdf describes an outdated version instruction listing. The datapath has been modified with the following changes:

 - ADDA instruction removed
 - BRAM instruction added

BRAM use:
	BRAM [Address]   PC <- MEM[Address]

This change was made because the current system could only branch to a predefined location. This would make it difficult to reuse subroutines
as they would always return to the same place. The ADDA instruction can be implemented using SUBA.

Ex:

@EQUATE A      0x05
@EQUATE A_NEG  0x05
@EQUATE B_ADDR 0x10
@EQUATE TEMP   0x50

MOVI 0x0
LAAD B_ADDR
STOR TEMP
MOVI A_NEG
STOR B_ADDR
MOVI 0x0
LAAD TEMP
SUBA B_ADDR

This change significantly increases instruction counts in addition-heavy programs. I found this to be the best way to enhance the architecture
without removing existing functionality.
